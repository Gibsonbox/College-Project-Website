                <p>Modern music can be produced entirely using software and this is what I use to create my own music. Software can be used as 
                a means to create music in a studio scenario without having to have all of the appropriate equipment. These days music production software is
                so sofisticated you may never need to even play an instrument to gain results which are professional. Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) have been
                around for some time now but recently they have provided users with a dynamic and versatile platform to produce music in. Modern DAWs are so 
                efficient they can be operated on many budget devices such as entry level laptops. Some DAWs are even available on mobile phones providing you
                with a musical playground on the move. There are several DAWs that can be used and are uses by industry professionals. This both aids
                their production ability and their workflow. FL Studio is a popular Windows-based DAW but others include Ableton, Pro Tools and Reason.
                Apple have their own DAW which is Logic Pro. Logic Pro can only be used on Mac-OS which is a shame as it is an incredibly powerful
                and versatile DAW. This is one of the reasons that many musicians will use Mac computers as Logic Pro has become somewhat of an industry standard.

                <p>Within a DAW, there are several tools to assit you in producing music. As seen in the image, you have a selection of functions within a DAW.
                    Shown within this page is a VST plugin. A VST is a piece of software which is injected into the DAW that provides functionality. 
                    This particular VST is a synthesiser. A synthesiser is a audio producing piece of software which allows you to generate various sound waves
                    through osillators and augment the sound these waves produce through a variety of processes. The processes can include modulation, which
                    is changes to the sound wave over time. You can combine osillators to create unique modulations or sounds as well as modulate wave forms by other wave forms
                    This particular plugin that is showcased is known as a wavetable synthesiser. It uses a wavetable to cycle through different instances of an 
                    audio wave to create modulation. This provides a unique sound which is constantly changing. Within this synthesiser you can modulate the pitch of
                    the instrument as well as the amplitude that effects have on the sound wave. Audio effects such as reverb, chorus, flanger and distortion are very common.
                    You can use the inbuilt funtionality of low frequency oscillators (LFOs) to create complexity to the modulation of various features within a synthesiser.
                    When you have crafted your sound you can also use filtering. Filtering allows you to control the frequency of the sound that is outputted from the synthesiser.
                    Filtering can be especially useful to shape the sound you want as it allows you to blend it into other already existing sounds in your song.
                    DAWs are not only used to create music. They can be used to create sound effects for films and television or for games. The use of a DAW
                    and subsequently the plugins which can be added to it are limitless.
